# EVRS
The EVRS aims to reduce delays for emergency vehicles caused by traffic congestion. Traditional lights and sirens are insufficient in many cases, especially in urban areas or noisy environments. This system employs technology to notify nearby vehicles, helping them vacate lanes and allowing emergency vehicles to pass quickly.
